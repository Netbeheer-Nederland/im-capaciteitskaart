| xref::class/EnergyArea.adoc[`EnergyArea`]
| +++Describes an area having energy production or consumption. Specializations are intended to support the load allocation function as typically required in energy management systems or planning studies to allocate hypothesized load levels to individual load points for power flow analysis. Often the energy area can be linked to both measured and forecast load levels.+++

| xref::class/PostcodeArea.adoc[`PostcodeArea`]
| +++A geographic region that is defined by the initial letters or digits of a postcode.+++

| +++Type of name. Possible values for attribute 'name' are implementation dependent but standard profiles may specify types. An enterprise may have multiple IT systems each having its own local name for the same object, e.g.  a planning system may have different names from an EMS. An object may also have different names within the same IT system, e.g. localName as defined in CIM version 14. The definition from CIM14 is The localName is a human readable name of the object. It is a free text name local to a node in a naming hierarchy similar to a file directory structure. A power system related naming hierarchy may be Substation, VoltageLevel, Equipment etc. Children of the same parent in such a hierarchy have names that typically are unique among them.+++

| xref::class/NameTypeAuthority.adoc[`NameTypeAuthority`]
