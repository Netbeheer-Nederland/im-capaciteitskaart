description: "The capacity heatmaps information model was defined to cover a superset\
  \ of\ndata exchanged by the NL system operators. A minimum set of data is defined\n\
  that all operators are expected to conform to, along with a number of\noptional\
  \ properties and data types.\n\n![Logical model](assets/im_capaciteitskaart-20240527.png)\n\
  \nThe data is intended to be presented as a hierarchy with a\n[HeatmapDataSet](HeatmapDataSet.md)\
  \ at its root, then\n[Substations](Substation.md) and [Circuits](Circuit.md) nested\
  \ inside the\n*HeatmapDataSet*. *Substations* and *Ciruits* then have their own\
  \ child\nelements forming a tree of data with the *HeatmapDataSet* at the root.\n\
  \nThis information model is based in part on the [LTDS Capacity Heatmap\nInformation\n\
  Model](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/decision/long-term-development-statement-direction),\n\

      names within the same IT system, e.g. localName as defined in CIM version 14.
      The definition from CIM14 is The localName is a human readable name of the object.
      It is a free text name local to a node in a naming hierarchy similar to a file
      directory structure. A power system related naming hierarchy may be Substation,
      VoltageLevel, Equipment etc. Children of the same parent in such a hierarchy
      have names that typically are unique among them.
