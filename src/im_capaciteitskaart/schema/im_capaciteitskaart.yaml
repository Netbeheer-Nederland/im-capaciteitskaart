title: Information model for the NBNL-capaciteitskaart.
version: 0.1
description: |-
  The capacity heatmaps information model was defined to cover a superset of
  data exchanged by the NL distribution system operators. A minimum set of data
  is defined that all operators are expected to conform to, along with a number
  of optional properties and data types.

  The data is intended to be presented as a hierarchy with a
  [HeatmapDataSet](HeatmapDataSet.md) at its root, then
  [Substations](Substation.md) and [Circuits](Circuit.md) nested inside the
  *HeatmapDataSet*. *Substations* and *Ciruits* then have their own child
  elements forming a tree of data with the *HeatmapDataSet* at the root.

  This information model is based in part on the [LTDS Capacity Heatmap
  Information
  Model](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/decision/long-term-development-statement-direction),
  which itself is published under the [Open Government
  License](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/),

          Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is

          achieved by using a UUID, as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID. The
          use of UUID is strongly recommended.\r\nFor CIMXML data files in RDF
          syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
          rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

  NameType:
    description:
      Type of name. Possible values for attribute 'name' are implementation
      dependent but standard profiles may specify types. An enterprise may have
      multiple IT systems each having its own local name for the same object,
      e.g.  a planning system may have different names from an EMS. An object
      may also have different names within the same IT system, e.g. localName
      as defined in CIM version 14. The definition from CIM14 is:\r\nThe
      localName is a human readable name of the object. It is a free text name
      local to a node in a naming hierarchy similar to a file directory
      structure. A power system related naming hierarchy may be Substation,
      VoltageLevel, Equipment etc. Children of the same parent in such a
      hierarchy have names that typically are unique among them.
