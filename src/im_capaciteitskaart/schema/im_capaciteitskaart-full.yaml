title: Information model for the NBNL-capaciteitskaart.
version: 1.0.0
description: |-
  The capacity heatmaps information model was defined to cover a superset of
  data exchanged by the NL system operators. A minimum set of data is defined
  that all operators are expected to conform to, along with a number of
  optional properties and data types.

  ![Logical model](assets/im_capaciteitskaart-20240527.png)

  The data is intended to be presented as a hierarchy with a
  [HeatmapDataSet](HeatmapDataSet.md) at its root, then
  [Substations](Substation.md) and [Circuits](Circuit.md) nested inside the
  *HeatmapDataSet*. *Substations* and *Ciruits* then have their own child
  elements forming a tree of data with the *HeatmapDataSet* at the root.

  This information model is based in part on the [LTDS Capacity Heatmap
  Information
  Model](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/decision/long-term-development-statement-direction),
  which itself is published under the [Open Government
  License](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/),
